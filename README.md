# Nutrient-Concentration-Prediction
This study aims to predict the concentration of nutrients (lignin) in plant tissues by measuring the NIR (1000 nm to 2500 nm) spectra (reflectance mode) of the plant tissues. The original dataset contains 500 measurements each with around 700 features (wavelengths). The dataset is augmented with approaches such as Gaussian noise adding and scaling. 
The architecture used is a 1D convolutional layer which shows excellent performance in analyzing spectral data.
